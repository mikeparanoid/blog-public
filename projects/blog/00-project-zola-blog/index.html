<p>I have wanted to build a blog for a while, and after trying a number of different static site generators, I settled on Zola, because I think it is the simplest tool to get the job done for myself.</p>
<p>Previously, I had played around with: Hugo, Pelican, and Lektor, but none of these were simple enough for me to be bothered to use.
After digging around on the internet I stumbled on Zola, which seems to be both simple enough to use, and well documented so that I can learn it fast. Additionally, Zola is distributed as a native binary, which is extremely simple to get up and running without running into dependency issues, or having to install nodejs or other unnecessary things. Zola comes with a built in web-server, and monitors changes so that the site is recompiled on the fly, allowing for quick development.</p>

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting started</h1>
<p>Getting started was easy enough as following the instructions from the <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola site</a>.
I also installed Vscode for IDE/text editor, and just added a TOML  syntax highlighting plugin, and a spell checker because I cannot spell.</p>
<p>I am using the theme from <a href="https://archie-zola.vercel.app/">https://archie-zola.vercel.app/</a>, which I have modified to suit my needs.</p>
<h1 id="publishing">Publishing</h1>
<p>I am hosting this site on Cloudfare, as it is free for static sites. The Zola documentation also has a tutorial on setting this up too.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Zola was a completely painless experience compared to the other SSG I played around with, and I managed to get this blog up and running in about 3 hours or so.
There are still a few features that I want to add at a later date: RSS Feed, a Contact form, and rebuild the theme to better for what I envision, but for now I consider what has been accomplished a great start.</p>
