<p>So I have wanted to start a personal blog now for a while as a place for me both document the projects that I build, but also to practice writing. I am also hoping that this blog will make me more accountable so that I start spending more of my spare time making things and being productive, instead of being endlessly distracted on the internet.</p>
<p>I am aware that it is standard for a programmer to have a blog. Many successful and well known programmers that I want to be like have a blog (or are they well known because they have a blog?), and I am a firm believer in shamelessly copying what successful people do until you have your own feel for it.
I am also well aware that no one may ever read this and that I could be talking to the void, but I do not mind. I think that the act and discipline of writing and maintaining this blog will be well worth the effort in the end, no matter what happens. I will get better at writing and communicating, as well as learning some webdev stuff, so a win in any regard. Maybe I will learn something about myself too in this process, who knows? I will be fun either way.</p>
